20 properties of CSS and what they do 
    1-Display; The display property controls the box type that an element creates.

    2-Color; The text color of an element is defined by its color parameter. Controls the 
    text color of the text.

    3-Syntax; A CSS stylesheet comprises a set of rules that the web browser interprets
    and then applies to the associated page components, such as paragraphs, headings, etc.

    4-Background; A background helps to customize am elements background color, background image,etc.
    
    5-Fonts; One must use the correct font and style for the text to be easily readable.
    Text font styling options in CSS include changing the font’s face, adjusting its size and 
    boldness, managing variants and so on. Font- family, -style, -weight, -size, and -variant 
    are the different font attributes.

    6-Text; CSS offers several features that make it simple and effective to specify different 
    text styles, including color, alignment, spacing, decoration, transformation, etc.

    7-Dimension; Developers can manage an element’s width and height using CSS’s several 
    dimension properties, including width, height, max-width, min-width, max-height, and min-height.

    8-Margin; Using CSS margin properties, setting the border-spacing for a box element is possible. 
    The margin of an element is always translucent, independent of the backdrop color.

    9-Lists; CSS offers many attributes for styling and formatting the most popular ordered and 
    unordered lists. People can usually control the marker’s form or look using these list attributes. 

    10-Links; A website cannot function without connections, often known as hyperlinks. It makes it 
    possible for users to traverse the website. Appropriately designing the links is a crucial 
    component of creating a user-friendly website.

    11-Layers; Because text, graphics, and other elements are arranged on the page without 
    touching one another, HTML pages are regarded as two-dimensional. Boxes may be stacked 
    horizontally, in vertical directions, and along the z-axis.

    12-Gradients; One can speed up downloads and use less bandwidth by utilizing gradients. 
    The output will render much faster because the browser generates it, and gradient-containing 
    items can be scaled up or down to any degree without losing quality.

    13-Outline; Developers can specify a box-shaped outline region around an element using its 
    outline settings. A line sketched just outside the elements’ borders is known as an outline. 
    The outline indicates focus or active states for elements like buttons, form fields, etc.

    14-Filters; The CSS filter property, which accepts one or more filter functions in the order
    specified, can be used to apply the filter effects to the element. Developers can use it to 
    implement visual effects like blur, brightness or contrast balance, color saturation, etc.

    15-Units; Absolute units, like pixels, points, and so forth, or relative units, can measure 
    length. For non-zero values, CSS units must be specified because there is no default unit. 
    A unit that is absent or ignored would be regarded as an error.

    16-Opacity; Opacity was present long before it was included in the CSS version 3 specs. 
    Older browsers, however, have various settings for opacity or transparency. The range 
    for the opacity attribute is 0.0 to 1.0. Using CSS opacity, developers may also create 
    translucent pictures.

    17-Validation; Website validation is the process of making sure a website’s pages 
    adhere to the formal standards and rules established by the World Wide Web Consortium 
    (W3C). Verification is crucial. It will ensure that all web browsers, search engines, etc.
    interpret your web pages the same way.

    18-Position; A good layout design requires that elements be placed correctly on the web pages. 
    You may position items using a variety of CSS techniques. You can read about these placement 
    techniques individually in the following section.

    19-Padding; You may control the distance between an element’s content and border using the 
    padding properties. The background color of the element has an impact on the padding. For 
    instance, if you set a background color for an element, the padding area will show that color.

    20-Tables; Tabular data, such as financial reports fetched from a database management system 
    (DBMS), are often displayed in tables. However, when you construct an HTML table without any 
    styles or attributes, browsers show them without a border. You can significantly enhance the 
    aesthetic of your tables with CSS.

    machine-readable date and time information along with its content.

How do we use bootstarp in HTML
    There are three methods of using bootstrap and these include;
        1-Using Bootstrap CDN
            CSS-Simply copy this stylesheet link to the <head> of your HTML file
            JS-The JavaScript functionalities of some components like dropdowns, tabs, etc depend on jQuery and popper.js.
            So, include jQuery and popper.js in the following order right before loading the bootstrap JavaScript file 
            for proper functioning.
        2-Downloading the files locally
            Instead of using CDN, you can download the files locally to your project folder 
            from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/ Once you download 
            the file, you can include the bootstrap.min.css file the <head> and bootstrap.min.js in <body>. 
            Even if you are using the downloaded bootstrap file, you have to include jquery.min.js and popper.min.js 
            before loading bootstrap.min.js 
        3-Using package managers
            Bootstrap can be easily pulled into any project using package managers such as ‘npm’, ‘yarn’ etc. 
            Since npm is the most popular package manager used by front-end developers, we are going ahead 
            with the npm command for installing bootstrap.

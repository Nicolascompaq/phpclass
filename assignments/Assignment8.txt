How do we declare variables in php 
    In PHP, a variable is declared using the $ sign followed by the variable name.

    -The value of a variable is the value of its most recent assignment.

    -Variables are assigned with the = operator, with the variable on 
    the left-hand side and the expression to be evaluated on the right.

    -Variables can but do not need to be declared before assignment.

    -Variables in PHP do not have intrinsic types - a variable does 
    not know in advance whether it will be used to store a number or 
    a string of characters.

    -Variables used before they are assigned have default values.

    -PHP does a good job of automatically converting types from one to 
    another when necessary.
